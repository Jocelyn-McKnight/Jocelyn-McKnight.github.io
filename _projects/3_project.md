As a team member in the [Humanities Innovation Lab](https://www.humanitiesinnovationlab.ca/), my primary role involves supporting the lab’s digital presence through media production and website development. I contribute to designing, maintaining, and updating the lab’s website, ensuring that our research projects and resources are accessible to both academic and public audiences.
