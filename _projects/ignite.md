At the Ignite Centre for eLearning, I contribute to the development of innovative online learning experiences through my work in instructional design. My role involves designing course content, adapting matterings to fit with an online learning environment, and ensuring that the moodle ecosystem for the whole high school program is running smoothly.

I collaborate with faculty to transform traditional course content into interactive eLearning experiences. This includes integrating multimedia elements, developing assessment tools, and optimizing the user experience to support diverse learners. My work emphasizes balancing educational technology with best practices in instructional design, ensuring that the Centreâ€™s digital courses foster meaningful learning outcomes.
