I am an undergraduate student currently pursuing a BA, majoring in English Language Arts, with a double minor in French and linguistics at the University of Lethbridge. I am involved in the Visionary Cross Project, works as an undergraduate TA in the Linguistics and Modern Language Department, and serves as an instructional designer for online secondary schooling in Alberta. My academic interests revolve around Old English philology, phonetics and phonology related to endangered Languages, and Digital Humanities.
